BOXES
use border-box instead of height and width
box-sizing: border-box
height and width defined for entire bosx instead of just for the content area

Block Level BOXES
elements formatted visually as blocks
100% of parents width (occupy as much as possible)
vertically one after another
display:

inline block BOXES
a mix of block and inline
occupies only content space
no line breaks
box model applies as shwon

Inline BOXES
content is distrubted in lines
occupies only contents space
no line breaks
no height and width available
paddings and margins only horizontal left and right


POSITIONING SCHEME
1 normal flow
defualt positioning SCHEME
not floated
not absolute positioned
elements laid out according to their source order

position:relative

2 floats
elements removed from the normal flow and moved to the left/right of the containing box
text and inline elements will wrap around the floated elements
the container will not adjust its height to the elements


float: left
float: right

3 absolute positioning
element is removed from the normal flow
no impact on surrounding content or elements - can even overlap 
we use top bottom left and right to offset the element from its relatively positioned container 

position: absolute
positon:fixed

4 stacking context
z-index  = higher z index on top
opacity transform filter all also define stacking context 

-------------
css architecture 
modular builing blocks
held together by layout of page
reuseable across project and between different projects
independent allowing us to use them anywhere on the page

BEM Style of Writing HTML/CSS 
Block =  .block{}
Element = .block__element{}
Modifier = .block__element--modifier{}

7-1 Pattern
7 differnt folders for partial sass files
1 main sass file to import all other files into
a combiled css stylesheet√ü


-----------
BASIC RESPONSIVE DESIGN PATTERNS
1) Fluid grids and layouts. Uses % rather than px for all layout
lengths
2) Flexible/Responsive Images. Images behave differently than
text content and we need to ensure that they also adapt nicely
to the current viewport. Use % rather than px, optimize width
3) Media Queries. To change on certain viewports

--------------------------

Float Layout = left to right ; old
Flexbox = left to right within rectangles ; new
CSS Grid = 4 boxes different width ; new new
